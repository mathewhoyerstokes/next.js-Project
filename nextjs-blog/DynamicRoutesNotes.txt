Dynamic Routes

    - We want the to create individual blog pages

    - We want the URL for these pages to be dependent on the BLOG data which means we need Dynamic routes

    - We want each post to have the path /posts/<id>, where <id> is the name of the markdown file under the top-level posts directory.

    - Since we have ssg-ssr.md and pre-rendering.md, weâ€™d like the paths to be /posts/ssg-ssr and /posts/pre-rendering
